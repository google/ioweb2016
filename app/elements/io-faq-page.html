          <p>The window to submit a registration application will open at 9AM PST on March 8, 2016 and remain open until 5PM PST on March 10, 2016, so you'll have plenty of time to apply.

The order in which registration applications are received has no bearing on the final outcome.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>You will need to sign in with a Google account to begin the application.</li>

If you are not sure whether the professional guidelines for your school, university, organization, or agency would allow you to accept these items, please check with your local ethics officer before the event.

Jokes shouldn't demean others. Consider what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you. </p>
          <p>Speak up if you see or hear something. You are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. Also, assume positive intent. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the festival organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the festival with no refund. If you are being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the festival staff immediately.</p>
          <p>Practice saying "Yes and" to each other. Build on each other's ideas. We all benefit when we create together.</p>

          <p>Smoking is only permitted in designated outdoor smoking areas.</p>
