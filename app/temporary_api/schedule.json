This session explains how you can use the ExoPlayer streaming media library to help provide your users with a great media experience. The talk provides an overview of the ExoPlayer's design, and highlights the advantages of ExoPlayer over other libraries such as MediaPlayer.\n\nThe ExoPlayer provides many sophisticated features such as Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH), SmoothStreaming and Common Encryption. It's designed to be easy to customize and extend, and many components can be replaced with custom implementations. Because ExoPlayer is a library that you include in your application, it can be easily updated along with your app.\n\nAfter attending this talk you'll understand how to integrate ExoPlayer into your application. If you are using it to replace MediaPlayer, this can be a quick and simple integration. However, you'll also come away with an understanding of the design and inner workings of ExoPlayer, including how to wire up ExoPlayer instances using custom components to satisfy the most demanding performance and UX requirements, as well as take full advantage of the sophisticated features provided by the player.",

Recent data from the Google Play Store revealed that the majority of users will never open an app again if they encounter two early-stage crashes. They are also more likely to give it a low rating and write a bad review. By mining the data from the 1-star reviews on Play, we recognized that more than half of these reviews are related to quality issues.\n\nIn this talk, we'll provide Google’s guidelines to building and publishing higher quality apps. We’ll walk you through various tools and suites that allow you to ensure higher quality for your applications throughout the development lifecycle.",

The Google Places API enables an app or website to present location data to users in a human-centered fashion. In this session we’ll do a deep dive into how you can use the Places API to discover your environment. We’ll give detailed insights into how to use these on web and mobile, show off some newly-released widgets, and take a look at how you can optimize for mobile device battery life. You’ll learn how the Places API can make all your apps -- not just map-centric ones -- smarter.",

To enable users to quickly and easily communicate with them, we've designed the Physical Web, an open-source system that uses beacons to enable lightweight interactions with nearby devices and locations. Come listen to Ani Mohan talk about how the Physical Web uses the latest beacon and web technologies to offer a range of ways to bring interactivity to everyday scenarios. We'll also describe how developers can get started today to build Physical Web experiences.\n",

      "description": "Lenses make VR possible. They allow us to look at a screen a few inches from our eyes, but feel like we're looking out across a vast virtual landscape. Unfortunately, they also warp our view of the virtual world, distortions that require expensive, per-pixel computations to correct. This talk describes a technique for performing these computations per vertex, removing the need for traditional full-screen render textures and massively improving mobile performance, which is particularly well suited to Cardboard VR apps.",

CAPTCHAs have traditionally been the first line of defense for fighting automated spam and abuse. However, as spammers have grown more sophisticated, the increased complexity of CAPTCHAs can be frustrating for end users, resulting in increased drop-offs.\n\nGoogle’s reCAPTCHA API has been on a mission to change this by providing an effective spam & abuse fighting tool with minimal user interaction. In this talk, we will introduce an updated UI and discuss a broad set of reCAPTCHA use cases. We will give a sneak peek into the machinery behind our spam and abuse fighting, and end with a demo of how easy it is to integrate reCAPTCHA into your site or app.",

Follow guided arrows to know which exit to take when you get off the subway, see how a sofa looks in your living room before you buy it, or watch zombies battle on your dining table. In this session, we will explore the vision of Project Tango and how it will come to life with the launch of our first consumer phone, announced earlier this year. \n",

Whether you’re an independent developer, startup, or an established company, tech policy decisions made in places like Brussels or Washington D.C. actually have a big impact on what you do every day. Yet navigating these proposals can be confusing, time-consuming, and full of legalese.\n\nWe’re here to help! Join this session hosted by Google’s Public Policy team where you’ll get a behind-the-scenes look at the year so far, and hear about we’re seeing coming down the road in the world of technology law and regulation. We'll be covering some of the biggest issues making headlines, including privacy, the future of the app economy, and more. We’ll also share the resources Google has available to help developers learn more and get involved. ",

Finally, some developers want complete control over every aspect of the presentation.  \n\nThis session will highlight the Maps APIs representing the full gamut of the developer experiences, enabling you to get going immediately and scale as necessary.

It's a funny book but Dan also takes a serious look at the dysfunctional culture of startups and in Silicon Valley in general. In a conversation with Chris DiBona, Dan will talk about the ideas he explores in \"Disrupted.\" He'll also talk about how he ended up working on \"Silicon Valley,\" and what it was like working in the room with a team that included former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo.

We'll find out what people are saying, in real-time, about the candidates.

In this talk, we will introduce you to the next level of automation using hands-on examples of industry standard tooling like Docker, a container format, and Kubernetes, a distributed automation platform. We'll cover the basics of modern day applications and how design patterns like microservices drive the need for more robust infrastructure. Then we'll cover packaging and distributing apps using Docker. Finally, we'll up our game to running applications on Kubernetes. By the end of this talk you'll have the knowledge needed to excel at scale.",
